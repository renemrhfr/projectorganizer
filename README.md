# ProjectOrganizer

Note: Documentation is in the works!.
There's also a lot of code-refactoring to be done, for example i overused the singleton pattern in this project.
Please consider i created this Project in  5 days.



## About
This tool is made to organize your songwriting workflow: Project Organizer always shows you the most relevant
Data: from early draft to final tweaks.
You can simply Drag & Drop a MP3 or WAV File and ProjectOrganizer creates a new Project for you.

Add Notes/ToDos, organise your Ideas with your defined Tags, keep track of who you sent your Demos to and more!

## Usage
Who doesn't know it: Inspiration hits and you start a new track. You're just not quite there to save it and give it a proper name
so you end up having a cool_idea45.mp3 in your bounces folder.
The following week you have a new idea, which is even better in your head. This ends up as another_one36.mp3, and the story goes on.
Project Organizer helps you with this: once you start a new draft, just bounce a clip and drag & drop the bounce into this program.
When you are looking for new drafts to finish, you can easily preview your drafts and decide which ones to start working on.
This way no draft gets lost, but you dont have to worry about looking through your file system for projects.

## Add a track
Once you start a new idea which could be worth keeping track of, just drag & drop the bounced mp3 / wav file anywhere into Project Organizer.

## Track stages
To keep your projects organized (pun intended), i implemented three stages:
- Draft
This is the starting point of each Project. Just a draft/idea that could be worth working on at a later time. 
- Work in Progress
Those are the tracks you are currently working on and plan on actually finishing.
- Scheduled for release
Once you got your track signed and/or have an actual release date you should set the Project to this stage. 
Here you can set a deadline and since this is the first page that pops up there should be no distractions.
